  <p>
    Welcome to the OwO developers' blog. Stay for a while, sit down, listen.
    <strike>on second thought, turn around when possible</strike>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is where Aurieh and Dean post happenings with OwO (the service) and OwO
    (the code). We also talk about our stupid ideas and stupid things we've been
    messing around with, like testing in production, screwing around with new
    software and (virtually) blowing stuff up.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you've never heard of it before,
    <a href="https://whats-th.is" title="OwO Homepage">OwO</a> is a private file
    hosting service currently hosted in Germany that stores hundreds of
    thousands of files <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt; 100M</code> (mostly
    screenshots) for a couple hundred users. Our code is
    <a href="https://github.com/whats-this" title="whats-this GitHub">open source</a>,
    and no logs are kept on uploads (we store anonymous information on CDN
    origin requests). OwO is a free service supported by donations that runs no
    advertisements.
  </p>

  <p>
    OwO also hosts a small GitLab server for it's users, a public
    <a href="https://matrix.org" title="Matrix Homepage">Matrix</a> homeserver
    for decentralized communication, and we are looking to host more public
    services that promote anonymity or decentralization.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some posts will be short and some will be lengthy, luckily for you the
    reader there are little <code class="highlighter-rouge">x minute read</code>
    things for each post displayed on the index and at the top of each post's
    page. The theme we use for this blog is Chalk, and there's a link in the
    footer to the GitHub page. You'll probably notice we changed it up a little
    bit, monospace fonts and some other small edits. The code for this blog can
    be found on
    <a href="https://github.com/awau/blog" title="awau/blog GitHub">GitHub</a>.

    <strong>Note: this blog probably contains coarse language.</strong> You have
    been warned.
